ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Jose, a Full Stack Web Developer.

I am passionate about technology, with a particular focus on programming. I am driven by my need to push my own limits and expand my knowledge through continuous learning and hands-on experience.

My journey in the tech world has been impacted by diverse educational experiences. Notably, the better part of my programming education by way of the intensive Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at "Soy Henry", has helped me to hone my skills through a variety of projects, from solo ventures to collaborative efforts.

Throughout my training, I have engaged with a wide spectrum of technologies, each providing me with valuable skills to tackle challenges in web development. Currently, I have experience working with JavaScript, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, Redux, various architectural patterns, and other industry-relevant technologies.

I'm exploring opportunities to leverage my skills in a dynamic, forward-thinking environment. I'm eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to a team that values innovation and growth.

If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile Full Stack Developer to join your team, I'd be excited to discuss how my skills and passions align with your needs. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
